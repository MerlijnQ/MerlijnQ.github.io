about_content: |
  A persistent, enthusiastic, and ambitious student with an interest in technology and innovation who enjoys working on beta-related group projects. 
  I have a good communicative and results-oriented view, and enjoy helping others learn.

  I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen, where I am also involved as a teaching assistant and mentor. 
  My background includes both academic and industry experience across education, sales, and fundraising, and I thrive in team-oriented environments.
