  Hey there, welcome to my website! The place where you can find out about projects I have worked on. However, let me first introduce myself:
  
  A persistent, enthusiastic, and ambitious student interested in technology and innovation who enjoys working on beta-related group projects. 
  I have a good communicative and results-oriented view, which I have used in multi-cultural environments. I did not only demonstrate this at the University of Groningen (RUG)
  but also during an [exchange semester](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/merlijn-mulder-a275b5236_exchange-haskell-wireframes-activity-7288237000871047169-mtWi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADrSPn8BOEDwMcp8qt4GjyhoB4g4mta1q6A) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design!

  I’m currently writing my thesis in OOD for BCI as my final project in the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the RUG. 
  In the future, I plan to pursue a master's in AI within the specializations of AI engineering and hybrid intelligence as the RUG.
  My background includes both academic and industry experience across education, sales, and fundraising, and I thrive in team-oriented environments.

          Together with my supervisor Ivo de Jong, MSc, I am researching out-of-distribution (OOD) Detection within the motor-imagery brain-computer interface Paradigm.
          An image classifier can distinguish a cat from a dog and can also distinguish using uncertainty techniques that it is presented with an image of a chicken
          on which it wasn't trained; this proves to be a bit more complicated from brain signals. Can we distinguish someone wiggling their feed from raising their arm when
          our deep learning model has not encountered a brain signal portraying raising the arm before?

        title: Mind Wandering and Auditory Stimuli

        description: |
          Mind wandering (MW) decreases performance in various attention tasks. We investigate how a task-relevant (cue) and a task-irrelevant (distraction) auditory stimulus affect MW in a
          sustained attention response task (SART). Using the ACT-R architecture, we build a simple MW model in which we simulate three conditions, consisting of a condition without an auditory
          stimulus and the different stimuli previously stated. Although MW remained near 50% across conditions, our results reveal that the auditory stimuli affect the timing of MW. Cues 
          significantly reduced MW at moments when a button press was required in response to a visual stimulus. The task-irrelevant condition displayed a similar but less pronounced effect.
          Whilst the paper linked is written by me, this was a group project together with Alexander Müller, Felix Michalak and Nienke Posthumus.

        title: Blockchain in certificate systems
        caption: 2024
        link_text: View Review
        link: /assets/Blockchain_paper_review.pdf
        description: |
          During my time at SUTD, I wrote a review on the paper Ethereum-Blockchain-Based Technology of Decentralized Smart Contract Certificate System (Xie et al. 2020).
          Digital certificates are vulnerable to tampering, cyberattacks, and voiding. Blockchain and smart contracts offer a transparent, immutable solution. 
          This paper reviews Open Certificates, a proposal using smart contracts in a 3-layer authority system to manage certificate roles.
          While effective in addressing these issues and enabling validation,
          the system has vulnerabilities, such as the election of system managers and the lack of downloadable PDFs for use with less modern institutions. 
          In this review, I propose integrating two other systems to overcome these limitations.

        description: |
          Together with Jerno Beuker, I developed a Data Loader in Python for machine learning applications following the OOP guidelines. This consisted of a data manager,
          eager loading system, lazy loading system, batch loader and data preprocessing techniques. Whilst the project is not made publicly available at the moment,
          an overview is attached.

          As a mentor, I helped a group of 8 first-year students transfer from high school to university. 
          This includes group and individual sessions one semester long. 
          Furthermore, I have been active as a teaching assistant for the courses Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,  
          Basic Scientific Skills, Cognitive Psychology, and Introduction to the Brain.

          I spent a semester abroad at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Apart from the cultural experience,
          I learned a lot about implementing compilers using a functional programming language like Haskell, Blockchain development,
          User interface design and Extended Reality technologies and development.
